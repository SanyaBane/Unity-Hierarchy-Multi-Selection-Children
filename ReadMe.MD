## What it does

This Editor script might help you if you have a situation when you need to select many (10+) sub-gameobjects

**If in such cases you don't want to do this:**
1. Expand parent.
1. Select sub-gameobject you need.
1. Collapse parent.
1. Repeat steps 1-3 for every sub-gameobject you need.

**Then you might want to use this Editor script.**

Works on sub-sub-gameobjects.

Obviously, script expects all "root gameobjects" have same structure.
