## What it does

This editor script might help you if you have a situation when you need to select many (10+) sub-gameobjects, and you do not want to manually:
expand parent, select object, collapse parent, rinse and repeat for every sub-gameobject.

1. Expand parent
1. Select gameobject
1. Collapse parent
1. Repeat 1-3 for every sub-gameobject you need.

Works on sub-sub-sub-etc. gameobjects

Obviously, script expects all "root gameobjects" have same structure.
